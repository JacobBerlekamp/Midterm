I am planning on creating a script that will combine text files. I want each text file to have one word and when they are all put together it will say something clever. 

I plan on doing this by using the getopts function to handle options and arguments. It requires at least one option (-o for the output file), and accepts multiple input files 

My -h will be a general help message 

And it will check that the output file has a .txt extension using a regular expression and warns the user if it does not


To use my script you type ./concat_files.sh -o (name of output).txt (names of .txt files with spaces between them)




I decided to add in the spacers on this commit because it was hard to tell what was what and when file 1 turned into file 2. I figured this way would be better.
